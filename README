Disclaimer!
I cobbled together this script without really knowing anything about
Objective-C, PyObjC or Cocoa, so it's a messy hack. I don't normally do Mac
dev (at least not native Mac stuff) so I didn't worry about doing everything
exactly right and clean from the start, I just wanted to get this done in a
weekend.

In short, the code is horrible.

Sorry about the xcode droppings - I'd keep them out, but I don't want to
have to figure out how to replicate the xcode environment again in the
future since I don't use xcode for anything other than this.
